# Waterline 2.0 Draft

> Waterline2 is not currently ready for production use yet, but it _is_ where all new feature development in Waterline will occur, to allow us to get the current [stable v0.x Waterline code base](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) to v1.0 status.
>
> This repo is where all development of recursive joins (aka "populate deep"), projections, WHERE subqueries, and all other new features is taking place.



Still curious?  Okay.  First, see [Introduction to Waterline2](./Introduction to Waterline2.pdf) for background on what this even is.  Then see see ROADMAP.md for what's planned and the contribution guidelines.  Feel free to send suggestions, etc. as PRs.  If you've caught the bug and are interested in becoming a bigger part of the project, please reach out to @mikermcneil, @particlebanana, or @sgress454 on Twitter.

If you're feeling experimental, you [can actually use parts of WL2 in your existing Sails app right now](./USAGE_WITH_SAILS), as long as you're using the >=0.10.x version of Waterline and/or Sails.  There are some pretty heavy crutches involved, and it's not particularly easy to set up right now, but cool to see nonetheless.  And obviously extremely important for testing if you're looking to get involved as a contributor.  Check out [USAGE_WITH_SAILS.md](./USAGE_WITH_SAILS.md) for details.  As long as you're comfortable with `npm link`, you should have no problem getting it to work.



## Usage

First, clone this repo and run npm install.  Then do:

```sh
$ node
```

And:

```js
var Waterline = require('./');
```

## Making Some ORM(s)

```js
var orm = Waterline({
  models: {
    user: { datastore: 'appDB' }
  },
  datastores:{
    appDB: { adapter: 'wlmemory' }
  },
  adapters:{
    wlmemory: require('./standalone/wl-memory.adapter')
  },
});

console.log(orm);

//------[ORM]------
// • 1 model(s)
// • 1 datastore(s)
// • 1 adapter(s)
//-----------------
```
